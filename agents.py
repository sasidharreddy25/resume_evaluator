Step 1: Analyze the job description provided below to extract precise details.
Job Description:
```{description}``` 

Step 2: Based on the analysis in step 1, extract the 'educational degree' that a candidate must have as mentioned in the job description. Provide the precise education details specified. If there are multiple optional degrees, list them in the same string separated by "or." parameter. Output it as a list. If the educational requirement is not mentioned in the job description, provide an empty list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                        
Step 3: Based on the analysis in step 1, extract the both technical, soft 'skills' that the recruiter is seeking in a candidate from the 'job description'. List each skill 'individually and distinctly', without grouping multiple skills together. Exhaustively extract all the skills mentioned in the job description as 'individual entities'.

Step 4: Based on the analysis in step 1, extract the level of experience that the recruiter is looking for in a candidate from the job description. List the experience level(s) in a list. If the experience level is not mentioned in the job description, then it shoukd be empty list.
The skills are very important, so please extract them exhaustively, including those mentioned implicitly.

Step 5: Based on the analysis in step 1, extract whether the recruiter is looking for a candidate with experience in a specific industry or possessing particular domain knowledge. If no such details are mentioned in the job description, provide an empty list.

Step 5: Based on the analysis in step 1, Extract all other requirements mentioned in the job description that do not fall under the categories of Educational Qualifications, Skills, Experience Level, or Industry and Domain Knowledge. Provide them in a list.

Step 6: Output a JSON Response with the following keys: "Educational Qualifications," "Skills," "Experience Level,", "Industry and Domain Knowledge." and "others". The values for each key should be lists of the respective extracted details. Ensure that the extracted values are not repeated across different lists.

Extract as many requirements as possible from the given job description into their respective categories.

Step 2: Based on the analysis in Step 1, you should respond to the recruiter's questions solely using the information in your resume. Analyze the recruiter's questions carefully and base your answers strictly on the details provided in your resume.
You 'should not lie' about anything to the recruiter, as lying will severely impact your chances of being selected for the job. If you lie, you will be disqualified from the recruitment process. If you do not know answer to the recruiter question then simply say "sorry, I do not know answer to your question".
When responding to the recruiter's questions, be precise and answer based solely on the information provided in the 'resume'. Avoid making "assumptions or adding any information that isn't explicitly mentioned in the resume" in your answer

Step 3: Ensure that the answer is precise and 'based on the resume'. Ensure your answer is strictly under 200 words. Base your response solely on information from the resume, without including any external knowledge.
Your answer should be "precise", using only the terms and wording specified in the resume. "Do not include anything not mentioned in the resume when communicating with the recruiter".

Step 4: Ensure that the "answer is exclusively based on the resume", with 'every word sourced directly' from it. The answer should focus solely on the topic asked by the recruiter, without discussing anything else.

Follow the above steps and give "precise answer", to the point answer to recruiter question.

Do not be generic in your evaluation. Thoroughly analyze how the candidate's answer meets the job requirements and provide the most accurate score. Only award a full score if the candidate's answer completely satisfies the job requirements in every aspect. Do not give a full score easily.
If the job requirement is experience with the project life cycle, only assign full marks if the candidate's answer covers all aspects of the project life cycleâ€”requirement gathering, planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. If only few are mentioned, then assign "partial marks".

Step 1: Analyse the given job requirement and candidate answer.
job requirement: 
```{requiremet}```

Candidate answer: 
```{candidate}```

Step 3: Verify whether the candidate's response to the job requirement is accurate and aligns with the job requirements. If the candidate's answer thoroughly and explicitly satisfies all the job requirements, assign a score of 1. If the candidate's response does not meet the job requirements, assign a score of 0.
The score ranges from 0 to 1. If the candidate's answer only partially matches the job requirements, assign a 'score between 0 and 1' based on the level of matching. "only in rare cases where answer matches all requirements you should assign a score of 1". You should assign 'partial marks' in the case of partial requirements matching.
If the candidate states they do not have expertise in the job requirement, assign a score of 0.

Step 4: Output a Json Response with score as key and respective score as value. Do not output anything extra information, just give score.
